### What is been mapped?
Ginger Business Flow is been mapped to ALM Test Set (in some ALM’s it been called Test Plan/ Test Suite).
The mapped Business Flow Activities Groups are been mapped to the mapped ALM Test Set Test Cases.
For each mapped Activities Groups, it Activities are been mapped to the matching Test Case Steps.

### Why to map Ginger Business Flow to ALM Test Set?
The mapping is been done for allowing exporting the execution results from Ginger to the matching entities in ALM.

### Why to do manual mapping?
Manual mapping is needed in case the Ginger Business Flow and the matching ALM Test Set are both already exists in the systems,
In this case, the automatic Export (from selected Ginger Business Flow into new automatically created ALM Test Set) or Import (Ginger Business Flow is been created automatically based on selected ALM Test Set) can’t be used and manual mapping of the entities is needed.

Note: Please use this wizard also for updating the manually mapped entities in case of a change in any of the sides.
